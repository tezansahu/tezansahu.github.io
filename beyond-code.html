                    <h2>About Beyond Code</h2>
                    <h3 class="overview-subtitle">Critical Strategies to Balance Technical & Soft Skills</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        You've spent countless hours learning how to <em>code</em>, <em>analyze data</em>, and <em>build models</em>.<br>
                        But do you know how to <strong>present your findings</strong>, <strong>persuade your audience</strong>, and <strong>solve real-world problems</strong>?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        If not, you're missing out on a huge opportunity to grow your career and make an impact.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>80% of data science projects fail to deliver value</strong> – not due to a lack of technical skills, but rather, the <em>lack of balance between technical proficiency & soft skills</em> such as communication, collaboration, and leadership.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        If you want to avoid being part of this statistic, you need to have both kinds of 'muscles to flex' for an impactful career. Imagine if you could <strong>influence stakeholders</strong>, <strong>lead projects</strong>, and <strong>create a personal brand that sets you apart</strong> from the crowd.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That's exactly what <strong>"Beyond Code"</strong> will teach you, with critical & actionable strategies to level up your career as a data scientist, analyst, or engineer.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                    </p>

                        <p>
                            From core concepts like <em>balancing technical depth & breadth</em>, <em>data-driven mindset</em>, <em>creativity</em>, <em>customer obsession & data storytelling</em>, to broader themes like <em>productivity</em>, <em>personal branding</em>, <em>leadership</em>, and much more, this book has it all!
