          It was back in January 2018 when I first heard of something called
          <i>blockchain</i> and its association with cryptography. This caught
          my fancy and I started reading about cryptocurrencies and blockchains
          frequently. After successfully completing a Blockchain Fundamentals
          course in June 2018, I came across a Facebook post about
          <i>ETHIndia Hackathon - Asia's biggest Ethereum Hackathon</i>. Seeing
          a lineup of some really interesting people as the speakers and judges,
          I was keen on getting an opportunity to meet them and explore more
          into the field of Blockchains. I decided to take part in this event
          and was overjoyed when my application was accepted. The next challenge
          was to find someone from IIT Bombay with whom I could team up. It was
          then when I realized that Akash Kumar and Deep Karman Pal Singh had
          also been accepted. So, we decided to hack together.

        <h3><b> The Preparatory Phase...</b></h3>
        <span>
          The problem statement stated that we had to hack to
          <b>build something on Ethereum</b> (it could be anything...a game, a
          DApp, another framework, anything!). In the short span of 1 week that
          we had before the hackathon, I started looking at DApp (Decentralized
          App) Development tutorial and familiarized myself with frameworks like
          <i>Truffle, Ganache-CLI</i>, etc. and also learnt <i>Solidity</i> to
          write Smart Contracts. Since the problem statement was completely
          open-ended, we discussed about relevant fields where DApps could make
          an impact.

          hackathon!

            It was around 8:00 am when we reached MLR Convention Centre. During
            the Check-In process and breakfast, we had a chat with the
            organizers and several participants from India and abroad.

            Day 0 kicked off with the organizers introducing the sponsors and
            their contributions to the blockchain space. What followed, was a
            series of great talks and short workshops by people from
            organizations including
            <b
              >Status, Lendroid, Matic Network, Consensys, MakerDAO, Dharma
              Labs</b

            and many more...

          The lunch and high-tea served as good opportunities to talk to the
          speakers. The talks and interactions helped us understand the
          humongous amount of development that had sparked off in this field
          over the last few years and started giving us a broader picture about
          Blockchains and their applications.
